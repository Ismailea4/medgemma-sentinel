**Night Surveillance Report**

**Patient:** Jean Camara (ID: MEDGEMMA_001)

**Surveillance Period:** 21:00-07:00

**Detected Events:** 4

**Executive Summary:**
Patient Jean Camara experienced a significant event during the night surveillance period, characterized by severe desaturation, high fever, agitation, and critical apnea. The events occurred sequentially starting at 20:44:51. The patient's vital signs were markedly abnormal during this period, indicating a potentially serious underlying condition.

**Event Timeline:**
*   **2026-02-18T20:44:51.449222:** Desaturation (Severity: high) - SpO2 bas: 86%
*   **2026-02-18T20:44:51.449222:** Fever (Severity: high) - Fievre: 39.5C
*   **2026-02-18T20:44:51.449222:** Agitation (Severity: medium) - Agitation anormale detectee
*   **2026-02-18T20:44:51.449222:** Apnea (Severity: critical) - Apnee detectee (11s)

**Vital Signs Analysis:**
*   **Desaturation:** SpO2 bas: 86% (Severe desaturation indicates impaired oxygenation)
*   **Fever:** Fievre: 39.5C (High fever suggests significant inflammation or infection)
*   **Agitation:** Agitation anormale detectee (Indicates potential distress, discomfort, or neurological changes)
*   **Apnea:** Apnee detectee (11s) (Critical apnea indicates a significant disruption in breathing, potentially leading to hypoxia)

**Sleep Quality:**
*   The night was significantly disrupted by the detected events, particularly the critical apnea and severe desaturation. Sleep quality was poor.

**Clinical Recommendations:**
*   **Urgent Medical Evaluation:** Immediate medical assessment is required to investigate the cause of the severe desaturation, high fever, agitation, and critical apnea.
*   **Monitor Vital Signs:** Continuous monitoring of vital signs, including SpO2, temperature, and respiratory rate, is recommended.
*   **Assess Underlying Condition:** Further investigation into the patient's underlying medical condition is necessary to guide appropriate treatment.
