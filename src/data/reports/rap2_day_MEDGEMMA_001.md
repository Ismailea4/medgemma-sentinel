---

**Chief Complaint**

Chest pain (Douleur thoracique)

**Symptoms**

*   Chest pain
*   Palpitations
*   Dyspnea on exertion
*   Syncope

---

*   **Physical Examination:** Not performed during the night surveillance period.
*   **Vitals:** Not available during the night surveillance period.

---

**Differential Diagnoses**

1.  **Cardiac:**
    *   Stable Angina (potentially exacerbated by exertion or stress)
    *   Arrhythmia (e.g., Supraventricular Tachycardia, Ventricular Tachycardia) leading to palpitations, dyspnea, and syncope
    *   Myocardial Infarction (less likely given night summary, but possible)
    *   Pericarditis (potentially associated with fever)
    *   Aortic dissection (less likely without specific findings)
2.  **Non-Cardiac:**
    *   Parietal pain (as listed in provided consultation data)
    *   Pulmonary embolism (less likely without specific findings)
    *   Anxiety/Panic attack (can present with chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea)

---

**Investigations**

1.  **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Urgent review and repeat if indicated.
2.  **Cardiac Biomarkers (Troponin):** Urgent review and repeat if indicated.
3.  **Chest X-ray:** To assess for pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or other thoracic pathology.
4.  **Echocardiogram:** To assess cardiac structure and function, rule out valvular issues or wall motion abnormalities.
5.  **Holter Monitor:** If arrhythmia suspected as cause of palpitations/syncope.
6.  **Blood Tests:** Complete Blood Count (CBC), Electrolytes, Renal Function, Liver Function Tests (LFTs).
7.  **Coagulation Studies:** (e.g., PT/INR, PTT)

---

**Treatment Plan**

1.  **Immediate Management:**
    *   Assess patient stability.
    *   Administer oxygen if desaturation persists.
    *   Initiate appropriate medications based on suspected diagnosis (e.g., antiplatelets, anticoagulants, anti-anginal agents, antiarrhythmics if indicated).
    *   Monitor vital signs closely.
2.  **Further Workup:**
    *   Perform recommended investigations listed above.
    *   Correlate investigation results with clinical presentation.
3.  **Consultation:**
    *   Consultation with relevant specialists (e.g., Internal Medicine, Pulmonology, Neurology) as needed based on findings.
4.  **Follow-up:**
    *   Schedule follow-up appointment for reassessment and further management planning.
